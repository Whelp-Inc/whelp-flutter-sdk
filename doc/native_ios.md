## 📦 Adding Frameworks

Find Framework files in this <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/150nBQZJO-1vVcmLxyWVxKhguaPAtD92t?usp=sharing" target="_blank">link</a>

1. Open the iOS project in Xcode.
2. Select the target.
3. Select `Build Phases` tab.
4. Click '+' button and select `New Copy Files Phase`.
5. Name the new phase `Embed Frameworks`.
6. Expand the new phase and change destination to `Frameworks`.
7. Drag and drop the Framework files into the new phase. These files are located in `Frameworks` folder of this repository. Use files from `Debug` folder for debug builds and files from `Release` folder for release builds.

## 🚨 Important notes
- For better performance it's recommended to use one `flutterEngine` instance for the whole application not to create a new instance every time you open the chat.

## 📞 Communication with the SDK
Communication with the SDK is done via `FlutterMethodChannel` and the channel name is `whelp`. Both native and Flutter (in this context Flutter is the Live Chat) sides can send messages to each other via this channel. 

Create a `FlutterMethodChannel` instance and set a `FlutterMethodCallHandler` to it to receive messages from Flutter:

```swift
let methodChannel = FlutterMethodChannel(
    name: "whelp",
    binaryMessenger: flutterViewController.binaryMessenger
)
```

### 📥 Receiving messages from Flutter
To receive messages from Flutter, you need to set a `FlutterMethodCallHandler` to the channel: 

#### - onLog 
Called when the SDK wants to log something. You can use this to log errors or warnings. 

```swift
methodChannel.setMethodCallHandler { call, result in
    if call.method == "onLog" {
        if let arguments = call.arguments as? [String: Any],
            let logMessage = arguments["message"] as? String {
            print(logMessage)
            
            if let stack = arguments["stack"] as? String {
                print(stack)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### - close
Called when the user clicks the close button on the chat screen. When received, you should close the chat screen. This is made manually because the SDK doesn't know how you want to close the chat screen, maybe some animations?

```swift
methodChannel.setMethodCallHandler { call, result in
    if call.method == "close" {
        flutterViewController.dismiss(animated: true)
    }
}
```

#### - handleUrl
Called when the user clicks a link in the chat screen. This option is useful if you want some links to be opened in Safari or in your own webview or even deep link to another screen in your app. 

```swift
methodChannel.setMethodCallHandler { call, result in
    if call.method == "handleUrl" {
        if let arguments = call.arguments as? [String: Any],
            let url = arguments["url"] as? String {
            // Handle the url here.
        }
    }
}
```

### 📤 Sending messages to Flutter
To send messages to Flutter, you need to call the `invokeMethod` method of the channel: 

#### - start
This method should be called with data shown below to configure the live chat before opening:

```swift
let data: [String: Any] = [
  // Replace with your own App ID and API Key from Whelp.
  "appId": "{appId}",
  "apiKey": "{apiKey}",

  // Title displayed under the header on the chat screen.
  "headerTitle": "Müraciətiniz bizim üçün dəyərlidir 💙",
  
  // User information for authentication.
  "fullName": "John",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phoneNumber": "+994501234567",
  "language": "AZ",

  // Identifier is based on which the identity and uniquness of the user is determined: 
  // if matched: previous chats of the user will be loaded, 
  // Else: a new chat will be created.
  "identifier": "email",

  // Can be Firebase Cloud Messaging token or any other unique identifier.
  "deviceId": "{fcm_token}"
]

methodChannel.invokeMethod("start", arguments: data)
```

## 📱 Example

The example code below is a minimal example of how to open the chat screen and you can change it to suit your needs as long as you protect the main logic.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Flutter
import FlutterPluginRegistrant

class FlutterDependencies: ObservableObject {
  let flutterEngine = FlutterEngine(name: "whelp")
  
  init(){
    flutterEngine.run()
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self.flutterEngine);
  }
}

@main
struct MyApp: App {
 @StateObject var flutterDependencies = FlutterDependencies()

  var body: some Scene {
     WindowGroup {
       ContentView().environmentObject(flutterDependencies)
     }
   }
}
```

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Flutter

struct ContentView: View {
  @EnvironmentObject var flutterDependencies: FlutterDependencies
  var body: some View {
    Button("Open Live Chat") {
      startFlutter()
    }
  }

  func startFlutter() {
      guard
          let windowScene = UIApplication.shared.connectedScenes
              .first(where: { $0.activationState == .foregroundActive && $0 is UIWindowScene }) as? UIWindowScene,
          let window = windowScene.windows.first(where: \.isKeyWindow),
          let rootViewController = window.rootViewController
      else { return }

      // Create the FlutterViewController.
      let flutterViewController = FlutterViewController(
          engine: flutterDependencies.flutterEngine,
          nibName: nil,
          bundle: nil
      )
      flutterViewController.modalPresentationStyle = .pageSheet
      flutterViewController.isViewOpaque = false

      // Create a FlutterMethodChannel to send data to Flutter.
      let methodChannel = FlutterMethodChannel(
          name: "whelp",
          binaryMessenger: flutterViewController.binaryMessenger
      )
    
      // Create a dictionary to hold the data to be sent.
      let data: [String: Any] = [
        // Replace with your own App ID and API Key from Whelp.
        "appId": "{appId}",
        "apiKey": "{apiKey}",

        // Title displayed under the header on the chat screen.
        "headerTitle": "Müraciətiniz bizim üçün dəyərlidir 💙",
        
        // User information for authentication.
        "fullName": "John",
        "email": "john@example.com",
        "phoneNumber": "+994501234567",
        "language": "AZ",

        // Identifier is based on which the identity and uniquness of the user is determined: 
        // if matched: previous chats of the user will be loaded, 
        // Else: a new chat will be created.
        "identifier": "email",

        // Can be Firebase Cloud Messaging token or any other unique identifier.
        "deviceId": "{fcm_token}"
      ]

    methodChannel.invokeMethod("start", arguments: data)

    rootViewController.present(flutterViewController, animated: true)
    
  }

}
```
